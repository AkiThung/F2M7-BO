# Special Input Output - Aki Thung

## The Idea 

the idea is to code a program that lets you use your hand to control the mouse. This means that this program 
wil be able to move the mouse and use Rmb, Lmb and Mmb. Eventually the idea is to make a game that uses these
inputs as well.

## What Am I Gonna Use?

I am gonna use python to make this project work, but python on its own is enought to make the project work.
Thats why I will be using some extra librarys. The librarys im gonna use on top of python are Mediapipe and OpenCV.
An alternative for python would have been Javascript, but i decided to use python because of the added librarys withing PyCharm.
Another reason i want to code with python is beacause i want to learn more about it.


## Possible struggles 

I could possibly have struggles with python because it hase been a while since I used it
## Time needed 

I will make this project in a time span of seven weeks. The first three weeks will be used for research and the following four weeks
for actually developing the project.
